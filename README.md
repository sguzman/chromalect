# Chromalect

**A research laboratory for visual language encoding.**

Chromalect investigates whether writing can be made easier to learn by adding reversible, digital-only visual layers: **stable colors for graphemes and reusable components, semantic families, compositional phonetic notation, tone and prosody marks, and optional mnemonic animation**.

**Status:** research/documentation bootstrap. No application, renderer, datasets, phonetic alphabet, validated palette, or Rust crate exists yet. Proposals are not results.

## Starting point

The first research profile is **Mainland Standard Mandarin (Putonghua), modern simplified Chinese, and Hanyu Pinyin**. This scope is deliberately narrow enough to test while the underlying concepts can later be evaluated on Latin alphabets, Arabic, Hangul, other Chinese language varieties, and additional writing systems.

### The core experiment

Compare a plain rendering with alternate overlays of the *same underlying text*:

1. **Identity:** every normalized reusable component gets a stable, uniquely assigned color.
2. **Semantics:** colors cluster into meaningful families without collapsing distinct identities into one color.
3. **Structure:** decomposition reveals component boundaries and positions.
4. **Historical sound clues:** identify which component plays a phonetic role *in this character*, if any.
5. **Actual pronunciation:** a separately designed compositional visual phonetic code, ideally inside the glyph cell, plus a clear fallback to verified phonetic transcription.
6. **Prosody:** conventional tone marks/contours, with contextual pronunciation kept distinct from citation readings.
7. **Motion:** optional, meaningful animations that aid learning, never mandatory or permanently moving.
8. **Plain mode:** turn all layers off and recover the original text.

**Hard rule:** a component never changes its assigned identity color simply because it appears in a different character. The same shape cannot be recolored stroke by stroke for decorative effect.

## What this repository is

A place to record hypotheses, design proposals, competing schemes, controlled test cases, critiques, and evaluation results **before** deciding what to implement.

It is **not** a branch of another knowledge base or a general language-learning platform. Any future executable code will be written in **Rust**, but there is no need to create a Cargo project before an experiment requires one. No UI, web stack, external service, or product direction has been selected.

## Why version experiments?

A beautiful rendering can be linguistically wrong. A pretty encoding can fail to be reversible. An attractive color palette can make characters less legible. Each scheme must therefore be explicit, testable, and reproducible; designs are not silently overwritten with unrelated rules.

## Current principles

- Preserve the source Unicode text independently of every visual overlay.
- Document assumptions and provenance; never treat an image mockup as validated linguistic analysis.
- Separate **component identity**, **component role**, **meaning**, **pronunciation**, and **display style**.
- A character may have multiple readings; context can change pronunciations and meanings.
- Use exact, uniform per-component fills before trying embellishments.
- Do not import third-party linguistic corpora or font outlines without reviewing their licenses.
- Visual density is adjustable by the learner; full information is a valid study mode.
- Accessibility means every encoded dimension can be inspected without reliance on color alone.

## License

The repository has the existing [MIT license](LICENSE). Third-party data and fonts may have different terms; the repository license does not supersede those terms.
